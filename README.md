# CORE VERTICAL — Energy & Power

This repository defines energy-system interpretation layers for CORE.

It focuses on coupling efficiency, losses, and resonance behavior.

## Scope
- Power flow interpretation
- Loss and efficiency visualization
- Coupling diagnostics
- Long-term system behavior insights

## Non-Scope
- No grid control
- No dispatch authority
- No physics engines
- No governance authority

## Architecture Position
Consumes outputs from MAGNETAR, THERMOS, HYDRA, and SIGNAL.

## Governance
Bound by CORE safety, auditability, and non-manipulation rules.
