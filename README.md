# CORE VERTICAL — Energy & Power Systems

This repository defines the Energy & Power vertical for CORE.

It is a **physics-grounded energy systems interpretation platform** designed to analyze,
model, and validate energy generation, transmission, storage, and loss across domains.

This vertical treats energy as a **measured and conserved physical quantity**, not an abstract KPI.

---

## Physics Stack (Authoritative)

This vertical composes the following engines:

- MAGNETAR — electromagnetic fields, induction, transmission, losses
- THERMOS — heat generation, dissipation, thermal limits
- KINETIC — mechanical motion, vibration, rotating systems
- HYDRA — fluid-driven energy systems (hydro, cooling, cavitation)
- CRYSTAL — material and lattice behavior (conductors, piezoelectric effects)
- SIGNAL — efficiency metrics, anomaly detection, coherence
- RGSR — multi-domain coupling and energy flow correlation

---

## Curated Real-World Phenomena

This vertical is curated to analyze:

- Power generation systems (thermal, hydro, electromagnetic, hybrid)
- Energy transmission and distribution losses
- Resonance and vibration in generators and turbines
- Thermal limits and failure precursors
- EM coupling and interference in power systems
- Energy storage behavior (mechanical, thermal, material-based)
- Grid-scale and isolated system dynamics (interpretive only)

Examples (non-exhaustive):
- turbine resonance leading to efficiency loss
- EM heating and conductor fatigue
- cavitation in hydro systems
- thermal runaway precursors
- cross-domain coupling that degrades output

## What This Vertical Is

- A **power systems physics analysis platform**
- A **loss, efficiency, and stability interpretation system**
- A **multi-domain energy flow correlation environment**

---

## What This Vertical Is NOT

- Not a grid control system
- Not a dispatch or switching authority
- Not an operational SCADA replacement
- Not an economic optimization engine

All outputs are **interpretive and advisory**, never controlling.

---

## Registries & Lenses (Maintained Here)

- Energy system archetype registry (turbines, generators, reactors, storage)
- Material and conductor property libraries
- Thermal and EM limit profiles
- Efficiency and loss metric schemas
- Sensor pack definitions for energy systems

---

## Output & Safety Requirements

All outputs must:
- clearly separate modeled vs measured values
- include efficiency bounds and uncertainty
- flag resonance or instability risk explicitly
- prohibit automated operational recommendations

---

## Governance

This vertical inherits all CORE governance and engine registry law.

No system defined here may:
- directly control energy infrastructure
- bypass CORE audit or permission enforcement
- export data without governed authorization
